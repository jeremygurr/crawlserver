Welcome to Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup: Circus Animals fork!
<br>
<br>
Check out the <a href='https://github.com/jeremygurr/dcssca'>github page</a> for details about what's different in this fork. 
Feel free to create an issue on the github site for this fork if you come across problems, with the fork, or this server.
I recommend starting all new games on the latest version, as the older version will be removed once a new version is released.
NOTE: the rc file is shared across versions, so you don't have to recreate it or your macros. Also the save game is shared,
so stick with the same version, or it will probably crash.
