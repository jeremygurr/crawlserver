Welcome to Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup: Circus Animals fork!
<br>
<br>
Check out the <a href='https://github.com/jeremygurr/dcssca'>github page</a> for details about what's different in this fork. 
<br>Feel free to create an issue on the github site for this fork if you come across problems, with the fork, or this server.
<br>Occasionally I'll need to restart this server to deploy a new version. If you are in the middle of a game when that happens,
you're game will be saved and you will be kicked off. Come back in a few minutes and you should be able to continue your game. 
<br>Sometimes your save game won't load successfully. Sorry about this, I'm not an expert with this codebase yet, and sometimes
mistakes are made. Please create a new issue on the github site when this happens and I'll deal with it promptly. If you don't
know how to do that, send an email to "jeremy at gurrfamily dot com" (replace the at with @ of course, and the "dot" with "." and remove the spaces).
