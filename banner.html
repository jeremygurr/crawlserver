Welcome to Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup: Circus Animals fork!
<br>
<br>
Check out the <a href='https://github.com/jeremygurr/dcssca'>github page</a> for details about what's different in this fork. 
<br>Feel free to create an issue on the github site for this fork if you come across problems, with the fork, or this server.
<br>I recommend beating the game at least once on easy mode before trying a more difficult mode so that you can become familiar with the
differences in this fork. There are many major differences here. I also recommend that you read the strategy guide and cheetsheet to
at least become familiar with the basics. Check out the github repo for the docs.
